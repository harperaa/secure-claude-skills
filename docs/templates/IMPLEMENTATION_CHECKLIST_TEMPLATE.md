## Emergency Procedures

**If Security Incident Detected:**

**IMMEDIATE (First 15 minutes):**
1. [ ] Roll back deployment (Vercel dashboard)
2. [ ] Revoke compromised credentials
3. [ ] Enable additional monitoring/logging

**INVESTIGATION (First hour):**
1. [ ] Review logs (Clerk, Convex, Vercel)
2. [ ] Identify affected users
3. [ ] Determine scope of breach
4. [ ] Document timeline

**RESOLUTION (First 24 hours):**
1. [ ] Patch vulnerability
2. [ ] Test fix thoroughly
3. [ ] Deploy to staging first
4. [ ] Deploy to production
5. [ ] Notify affected users (if required)

**POST-INCIDENT:**
1. [ ] Update threat model
2. [ ] Add to security decision log
3. [ ] Create tests to prevent recurrence
4. [ ] Update this checklist
