# Threat Model

**Project:** [Your App Name]
**Last Updated:** [Date]
**Based On:** Secure Vibe Coding OS Security Architecture

---

## Purpose

This document identifies what we're protecting, who might attack us, how they might attack, and how we defend against each threat.

---

## 1. Assets (What We're Protecting)

### User Data
- Email addresses and authentication credentials
- Profile information (names, bios, preferences)
- Subscription and payment status
- [Your app-specific user data]

**Impact if compromised:** High - User trust lost, potential GDPR violations

### Business Data
- [Your business-critical data]
- Analytics and usage metrics
- Admin access and configurations

**Impact if compromised:** [High/Medium/Low] - [Explain impact]

### System Access
- Clerk API keys (authentication access)
- Convex deployment credentials (database access)
- Stripe API keys (payment processing)
- [Your AI service] API keys
- Webhook signing secrets

**Impact if compromised:** Critical - Attacker gains full system access

### Intellectual Property
- [Your unique features/algorithms]
- Business logic and rules
- [Your app's differentiators]

**Impact if compromised:** [High/Medium/Low] - [Competitive advantage loss]

---

## 2. Threat Actors (Who Might Attack)

### Malicious Users
**Motivation:** Access others' data, bypass payment, abuse features
**Capabilities:** Basic to intermediate technical skills
**Likelihood:** High (always present)

### Automated Bots
**Motivation:** Credential stuffing, spam, resource abuse
**Capabilities:** Automated tools, high volume attacks
**Likelihood:** High (constant background noise)

### Script Kiddies
**Motivation:** Fun, bragging rights, minor mischief
**Capabilities:** Use existing exploit tools
**Likelihood:** Medium

### Competitors
**Motivation:** Steal business logic, understand pricing
**Capabilities:** Technical expertise, well-funded
**Likelihood:** Low to Medium

### Compromised Accounts
**Motivation:** Varies (account was hacked)
**Capabilities:** Legitimate user access
**Likelihood:** Low but impactful

---

## 3. Attack Vectors & Scenarios

### Vector 1: API Endpoints

**Threat:** Unauthorized access to API endpoints
**Attack Scenario:**
1. Attacker discovers `/api/users` endpoint
2. Attempts to access without authentication
3. Tries to bypass with forged tokens
4. Attempts brute force to guess valid requests

**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** High (data exposure)

**Mitigations in Place:**
- ✅ Clerk authentication required on all protected routes
- ✅ Rate limiting (5 requests/minute per IP)
- ✅ CSRF protection on state-changing operations
- ✅ Input validation on all user-provided data

**Status:** Protected

---

### Vector 2: User Input Fields

**Threat:** XSS and injection attacks via user input
**Attack Scenario:**
1. Attacker enters `<script>steal(cookies)</script>` in bio field
2. Other users view the profile
3. Malicious script executes in their browsers
4. Attacker steals session cookies

**Likelihood:** High (common attack)
**Impact:** High (session hijacking)

**Mitigations in Place:**
- ✅ Zod validation sanitizes: `< > " &`
- ✅ React automatically escapes JSX output
- ✅ CSP headers restrict script execution
- ✅ Input length limits prevent large payloads

**Status:** Protected

---

### Vector 3: Payment Processing

**Threat:** Fake payment confirmation or payment bypass
**Attack Scenario:**
1. Attacker tries to access paid features without subscribing
2. OR: Attacker sends fake webhook claiming payment succeeded
3. System grants access based on fake confirmation

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High (revenue loss)

**Mitigations in Place:**
- ✅ Clerk handles webhook signature verification
- ✅ Subscription status checked server-side (Clerk)
- ✅ Client cannot bypass Protect component
- ✅ No local payment processing (Stripe handles)

**Status:** Protected

---

### Vector 4: [Your Custom Vector]

**Threat:** [Specific to your app]
**Attack Scenario:**
[Describe step-by-step how attack would happen]

**Likelihood:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Impact:** [High/Medium/Low]

**Mitigations:**
- [Your mitigation 1]
- [Your mitigation 2]

**Status:** [Protected / Needs Work / Accepted Risk]

## 5. Residual Risks (Accepted)

### Risk 1: No Authorization Middleware Yet

**Description:** Currently no resource ownership checks (because no user-owned resources exist yet)
**Impact:** Low (no features with ownership currently)
**Accepted because:** Will implement when adding features with ownership
**Monitor:** Review when adding user-generated content features

### Risk 2: [Your Accepted Risk]

**Description:** [What risk you're accepting]
**Impact:** [Low/Medium/High]
**Accepted because:** [Your reasoning]
**Monitor:** [How you'll track if this becomes a problem]

---

## 6. Future Threat Considerations

**As the app grows, watch for:**

**When adding user-generated content:**
- Threat: Users uploading malicious files
- Mitigation needed: File type validation, virus scanning

**When adding admin features:**
- Threat: Compromised admin account
- Mitigation needed: Role-based access control, admin action logging

**When scaling:**
- Threat: DDoS attacks
- Mitigation needed: CDN, WAF, advanced rate limiting

**When going global:**
- Threat: Compliance violations (GDPR, regional laws)
- Mitigation needed: Data localization, consent management

---

## Review Schedule

- **Monthly:** Quick review of threat landscape
- **Quarterly:** Full threat model update
- **After security incident:** Immediate update
- **Before major feature launch:** Add new threats

**Remember: Threat modeling is not one-and-done. Your threats evolve as your app evolves.**
